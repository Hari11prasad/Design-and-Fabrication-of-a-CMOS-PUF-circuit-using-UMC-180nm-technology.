# Design-and-Fabrication-of-a-CMOS-PUF-circuit-using-UMC-180nm-technology.
CMOS Ring Oscillator PUF designed and simulated in Cadence Virtuoso using UMC 180nm CMOS technology. Implements four ring oscillators, MUX-based challenge selection, 10-bit counters, and comparator to generate unique, stable 1-bit responses for hardware security and device authentication.
